## Requirements/Description
### User Story
* AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities 
* SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
<br>
<br>

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
> WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
> WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
>  WHEN I view the UV index
* THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
> WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
